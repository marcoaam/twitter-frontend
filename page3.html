			    <p>This is the content of page 1 in the jScroll example. Scroll to the bottom of this box to load the next set of content.

This is example text for the jScroll demonstration. jScroll is a jQuery plugin for infinite scrolling, endless scrolling, lazy loading, auto-paging, or whatever you may call it.

With jScroll, you can initialize the scroller on an element with a fixed height and overflow setting of "auto" or "scroll," or it can be set on a standard block-level element within the document and the scrolling will be initialized based on the brower window's scroll position.

jScroll is open-source and can be downloaded from my GitHub repository at github.com/pklauzinski/jscroll.
